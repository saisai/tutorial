JSON - Introduction

JSON: JavaScript Object Notation.

JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.

JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.

Exchanging Data
When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text.

JSON is text, and we can convert any JavaScript object into JSON, and send JSON to the server.

We can also convert any JSON received from the server into JavaScript objects.

This way we can work with the data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.

Sending Data
If you have data stored in a JavaScript object, you can convert the object into JSON, and send it to a server:

var myObj = {name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York"};
var myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
window.location = "demo_json.php?x=" + myJSON;


Receiving Data
If you receive data in JSON format, you can convert it into a JavaScript object:

var myJSON = '{"name":"John", "age":31, "city":"New York"}';
var myObj = JSON.parse(myJSON);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myObj.name;

*
JSON uses JavaScript syntax, but the JSON format is text only.
Text can be read and used as a data format by any programming language.

Convert json text(javascript object text) to json text.
myObj = {name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York"};
myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
myJSON = '{"name": "John", "age": 31, "city": "New York"}';

Convert  json text (javascript object text) to object (javascript object)
Obj = JSON.parse(myJson);
myObj = Obj => {name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York"};
