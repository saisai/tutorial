/*
Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers.
Operator 	Name 					Description
& 			AND 					Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
| 			OR 						Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
^ 			XOR 					Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
<< 			Zero fill left shift 	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>> 			Signed right shift 		Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
