Find square of a number without using multiplication and division operator
Given an integer, find its square without using multiplication and division operator. Also, use of power function from any programming language library is not allowed.

Method 1:
The idea is based on the fact that square root of any number n can be calculated by adding odd numbers exactly n times. The relation can be expressed as â€“

12 = 1
22 = (1 + 3) = 4
32 = (1 + 3 + 5 = 9)
42 = (1 + 3 + 5 + 7) = 16
